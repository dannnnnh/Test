“I then most always saw, with
great wonder, that in the said
matter there were many very little
living animalcules, very prettily
a-moving.”
— Antonie van Leeuwenhoek.
Despite being considered by many as
a relatively modern field of research,
the first descriptions of humanassociated microbiota date back to
the 1670s–1680s, when Antonie van
Leeuwenhoek started using his newly
developed, handcrafted microscopes.
In a letter written to the Royal Society
of London in 1683, he described
and illustrated five different kinds
of bacteria (although he called them
animalcules at the time) present in
his own mouth and that of others,
and subsequently also compared
his own oral and faecal microbiota,
determining that there are differences
between body sites as well as between
health and disease. Some of the first
direct observations of bacteria were
of human-associated microbiota.
Fast-forward a couple of centuries and, in 1853, Joseph Leidy
published a book entitled A Flora
and Fauna within Living Animals,
which some consider to be the
origin of microbiota research. Then,
the work of Pasteur, Metchnikoff,
Koch, Escherich, Kendall and a few
others, laid the foundations of how
we understand host–microrganism
interactions. Pasteur developed the
germ theory of disease, but also
thought that non-pathogenic microorganisms might have an important
role in normal human physiology;
Metchnikoff believed that microbiota
composition and its interactions
with the host was essential for health;
and Escherich was convinced that
understanding the endogenous flora
was essential for understanding
the physiology of digestion and the
pathology and therapy of intestinal
disease. Sound familiar? The themes
we explore in these ‘Milestones in
human microbiota research’ largely
brought to bear the hypotheses and
early work of these microbiology
giants, on the shoulders of which the
field stands today.

25 milestones, we want to highlight
particular areas of research — both
established and burgeoning — that
have contributed to a better understanding of our microbial selves, as
well as methodological advances
that have propelled the field forward. We also want to highlight
important but lesser known aspects
of the field, such as the fact that our
microbiota is not just composed of
bacteria; that human-associated,
health-promoting microbial communities exist on all bodily surfaces,
not only our gut; and, importantly,
that to have a complete picture
of the functional capacity of our
microbiota and its roles in human
health, we need to look beyond the
gut of white, Western populations.
We thank the many researchers
from all corners of the field who
have advised on the different aspects
of this project, as well as those who
have participated in the podcasts.
It is, of course, impossible to cover
everything in a field as broad and
diverse as this one, but we hope to
have captured the major steps forward. In our attempt to summarise
almost 350 years of research, we will
have unavoidably missed important contributions and sincerely
apologize for any unintended oversights. Although we have focussed
these milestones on the study of
human-associated microbiota, other
vibrant research communities are
trying to understand plant- and
animal-associated, as well as environmental, microbial communities.
We hope that this journey through
history will be inspirational and
we look forward to the exciting
developments that are sure to come,
ultimately aiming to harness our
understanding of microbial communities to improve not only human
health, but that of plants, animals
and ecosystems.

In 1890, Koch published his
famous postulates, four criteria
designed to establish a causative relationship between a microorganism
and a disease, and during the first
half of the twentieth century, microbiology became more focused on the
identification of etiological agents of
disease. This was also likely due to
the fact that most bacterial pathogens
can grow in the presence of oxygen,
whereas most members of the gut
microbiota cannot and thus could
not be studied at the time. Alfred
Nissle, a German physician, isolated
the Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 strain
— which remains a commonly used
probiotic — in 1917. During World
War I, when the first gut eukaryotic
microorganisms and bacteriophages
were also described, Nissle noticed
that one soldier did not succumb to
dysentery and thought he might have
a protective microorganism in his
gut. He isolated the strain and later
showed that it antagonized other
pathogens, establishing the concept
of colonization resistance, whereby
human-associated microorganisms
prevent the establishment of pathogens in the same niche.
Despite these early insights, the
field only took off in earnest once
methods to culture anaerobic organisms were discovered in the 1940s
and 1950s, when members of the
microbiota were grown and studied
in the laboratory. This is where we
have chosen to start our timeline of
milestones, as increasing numbers
of researchers became interested in
understanding the composition and
function of the microbial communities that live on our different surfaces
and how they change throughout
our lives. The realization that much
of the normal physiology of conventional laboratory mice was missing
in germ-free mice, and could be
reconstituted through colonization
with bacteria obtained from faeces,
enabled the first in vivo experiments.
Comparisons of germ-free and
colonised animals in the 1960s led to
observations that predicted much of
what has since been discovered using
methodologies that enable more
in-depth analyses. Despite advances
in culturing microorganisms, it soon
became apparent that there were
gross discrepancies between the
numbers of existing cells and how
many could grow in the lab, what
became known as the ‘great plate
count anomaly’. This key observation motivated the development
of sequencing-based approaches
to identify unculturable microorganisms, which were pioneered by
Woese, Pace, Fox and others to study
environmental microorganisms and
subsequently adapted to the analysis
of human-associated communities,
providing an unprecedented view
into their composition. A key step
in popularising microbiota research,
which got it into the mainstream
news and made it a household concept, was the finding by the Gordon
group, in 2006, that reconstituting
mice with the microbial communities
associated with a human disease state
could transplant the phenotype to
the animals. This opened the door
to research trying to establish causal
relationships between altered microbial communities and disease, which
has become a cornerstone of the field.
Although the first use of faecal
microbiota transplantation (FMT) in
Western medicine was published in
1958 by Ben Eiseman and colleagues,
who successfully treated four people
suffering from pseudomembranous
colitis (before Clostridioides difficile
was the known cause), FMT was
already used in ancient Chinese
medicine. Fourth-century Chinese
medical literature mentions its use,
by Ge Hong among others, to treat
food poisoning and severe diarrhoea.
In the sixteenth century, Li Shizhen
used oral administration of a ‘soup’
containing fresh, dry or fermented
stool to treat abdominal diseases.
In seventeenth century Europe, the
Italian Fabrizio and the German
Paullini documented the use of FMT,
and the American microbiologist
Stan Falkow candidly recalled his
role in preparing first-generation
poop pills to reconstitute the gut
communities of surgical patients a
year before Eiseman and colleagues
published their work.
We recognize that an enormous
body of work precedes each
milestone that we have selected to
highlight progress in this field. This
foreword aims to pay homage to
some of these microbiota pioneers.

Understanding the role of our microbiota in health and disease has long
been hampered by the strict growth
requirements of many of its constituent members. Underpinning modern
day investigations into the vast complexity and functions of the human
microbiota are fundamental methodologies to culture anaerobic bacteria
outside their natural environment.
From the rudimentary oxygen-free culture methods in the era
of Pasteur, and subsequent advances
in surface culture in the early twentieth century, the mid-1900s saw a
substantial expansion and refinement
of anaerobic culture techniques,
largely due to the pioneering work of
Robert. E. Hungate. In a 1944 study of
cellulose-degrading microorganisms
in the bovine rumen, his revolutionary roll-tube approach enabled the
successful culture of Clostridium cellobioparus and, in 1950, he published a
complete description of his technique.
The protocol used rubber-stoppered
tubes of boiled culture medium with
cellulose agar, through which anoxic
gas was bubbled to remove any
remaining oxygen. Firstly, passing this
gas through a column of hot, reduced
copper wire excluded any oxygen
from the gas itself, and the subsequent
addition of a reducing agent to the
medium removed residual traces of
oxygen. Rolling tubes under cold
water produced a thin layer of solid
agarose medium, and for the first
time, anaerobiosis was maintained
throughout manipulations using
a constant flow of anoxic gas. The
method, now known as ‘the Hungate
technique’, is still in use to this day.
Several modifications later
emerged, such as the VPI (Virginia
Polytech Institute) method for largerscale culture introduced by Moore in
1966, using prereduced medium and
prehardened roll tubes. Hungate also
made adaptations to culture methanogens, the strictest of anaerobes,
reported in 1969. Others, such as
Spears and Freter in 1967, similarly
recognised the importance of continuously avoiding any exposure to
oxygen, yet the Hungate technique
was still more efficient and enabled
a wealth of anaerobes that had not
grown previously in surface cultures
to be isolated for further study.
Alternative approaches used today
were also launched in the mid-late
1960s, namely the GasPak and the
anaerobic glove-box. The former, a
self-contained combustion jar system,
quickly made surface culture of
anaerobic microorgansims accessible
to more laboratories. The glove-box, a
sealed chamber with attached gloves,
filled with anoxic gases, was also a
popular choice, simplifying equipment and procedures for oxygen-free
culture.
As well as apparatus to create an
oxygen-free environment, culturing
anaerobes requires appropriate
media, which must have a low
oxidation-reduction potential, as
well as the substrates obtained by
microorganisms in their natural
habitat. Many researchers working on
Bacteroides species were instrumental
in determining the requirements of
specific anaerobic microorganisms,
and a recent breakthrough in media
composition (the inclusion of antioxidants) has since permitted the aerobic
growth of anaerobic bacteria.
Moving into the twenty-first
century, the advent of metagenomics
revealed that the majority of environmental microbial biodiversity
remained uncultured, inspiring
a rebirth of culture techniques.
Recent culture-dependent efforts
to characterize the human microbiota (see MILESTONE 19) utilised
dilution culturing and culminated
in the development of culturomics;
a high-throughput methodology
using hundreds of different culture
conditions, prolonged incubations,
and matrix-assisted laser desorption/
ionization–time of flight (MALDI–
TOF) spectrometry, combined with
16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing
for the rapid identification of a great
number of previously uncultured gut
bacteria.
With a large proportion of the
human microbiota requiring oxygen-free growth conditions, early
breakthroughs in anaerobic culture
were crucial in enabling more of
our microbiota to be isolated and
classified, and for their metabolism,
distribution and roles within the
microbiota to be studied. Initial
methodologies paved the way for
higher-throughput technologies
that provide vital insights about the
functions of the bacteria inhabiting
the human body, and their effects
on the human host. Now, with our
understanding of the importance of
the gut microbiota in human health
advancing by the day, we are even
more indebted to these early researchers and their innovations enabling the
culture of anaerobes.

In 1958, Eiseman et al. reported the
successful treatment of pseudomembranous enterocolitis using a faecal
enema. Since then, faecal microbiota
transplantation (FMT) has become
widely accepted as a successful rescue
treatment for recurrent Clostridioides
difficile infection. FMT is also being
investigated for other indications.
Eiseman and colleagues presented
the cases of four patients with
pseudomembranous enterocolitis.
They used enemas with faeces from
healthy donors after other therapy
options failed. The patients had a
rapid recovery from their symptoms.
C. difficile infection can cause
debilitating diarrhoeal symptoms
when the bacterial spores germinate
into vegetative cells that produce
enterotoxins, resulting in colonic
inflammation and the formation
of ‘pseudomembranes’ consisting
of inflammatory cells, dead cells
and debris. Over the past couple of
decades, C. difficile infection has
increased in incidence, morbidity
and mortality, and has become
known as a ‘superbug’. Despite antibiotics being the standard treatment
for C. difficile infection, they also
often are the cause of infection owing
to their suppressive effects on native
gut microbiota and subsequent
overgrowth of C. difficile. Eiseman
and colleagues also noted this link
to prior broad-spectrum antibiotic
treatment in their patients and speculated that disruption of the ‘healthy
gut flora’ underlies infection.
The intention of performing FMT
is restoration of the normal function
of the gut microbiota. In Eiseman
and colleagues’ report, culture
of stool samples obtained during
infection showed the presence of
Staphylococcus aureus, which, at the
time, was considered to be a possible cause of pseudomembranous
enterocolitis. S. aureus disappeared
from the stool sample cultures
after administration of a faecal
enema in association with clinical
improvement. The authors suggested
that normal colonic non-pathogens displaced the colitis-causing
pathogen, which, decades later, was
demonstrated to be C. difficile.
Since Eiseman and co-workers’
publication, others have reported
success using faecal enemas,
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (a probiotic) and bacteriotherapy (using a
mixture of facultatively aerobic and
anaerobic bacteria) to treat relapsing
C. difficile enterocolitis.
FMT is now an effective treatment option for recurrent C. difficile
infection and is believed to normalize the microbial diversity and
community structure in the colon.
Currently, a research consortium
is recruiting patients to a clinical
trial examining whether FMT is
safe, and can prevent recurrent
C. difficile-associated disease. FMT
could inhibit C. difficile by multiple
mechanisms, such as suppression by
antimicrobial peptides, inhibition
of spore germination and vegetative
growth, competition for nutrients,
and activation of colonization
resistance (MILESTONE 13).
To reduce costs and increase
patient and clinician convenience,
oral delivery of faecal microbiota has
been tested. In 2017, a randomized
clinical trial showed that FMT delivery by oral capsule was non-inferior
to delivery via colonoscopy, suggesting oral capsules could be an effective
treatment approach for recurrent
C. difficile infection.
FMT has also been investigated
for non-C. difficile indications, such
as ulcerative and drug-induced
colitis, and has shown some promise.
FMT from lean donors has also been
shown to increase insulin sensitivity
in men with metabolic syndrome.
Thus, since the pioneering report
from Eiseman and colleagues, FMT
has become an effective therapy for
recurrent C. difficile infection and
shows promise for treating other
diseases.

Germ-free animals are raised under
sterile conditions to prevent colonization with bacteria and other microorganisms. These animals (mostly
mice and rats, but also guinea pigs
and chicks) have a life span similar to
that of conventional, normally colonized animals, although they seem
to have a slower or impaired growth
as well as some anatomical and
physiological differences (such as an
enlarged cecum). By the 1960s, germfree animals were a well-established
tool in nutritional studies aiming to
understand the contribution of the
intestinal microbiota to host dietary
requirements (for example, with
regard to the synthesis of vitamins).
In 1965, Schaedler and colleagues
introduced a new use for GF animals:
the transfer of bacterial cultures to
germ-free mice. Such transfer experiments have been essential in studying
the effects of the gut microbiota on
the host ever since. In their pivotal
study, Schaedler and colleagues
reported the results of feeding
bacterial cultures isolated from the
gut of Nelson–Collins–Swiss (NCS)
mice (a colony of albino mice that
are free of ordinary mouse pathogens
as well as intestinal Escherichia coli
and Proteus spp.) to germ-free mice.
The germ-free mice were fed food
inoculated with individual bacterial
cultures of several anaerobic isolates.
After one week, the numbers and
localization of these bacterial strains
in the gastrointestinal tract were
comparable to those observed in
the NCS mice and remained stable
for several months, confirming the
feasibility of microbiota transfer
experiments and their usefulness for
studying bacterial gut colonization.
Importantly, transfer of a Bacteroides
strain partially reduced the cecum
enlargement typical of germ-free
mice, and the offspring of germ-free
mice that had been colonized with
a mixture of strains inherited those
strains and subsequently showed
normal cecum size and structure.
These results directly showed the
important and profound effect of the
gut microbiota on host development
and physiology.
This landmark study paved the
way for further research on the
effects of the gut microbiota on
the host and on the interactions
between different species of the
gut microbiota. For example, one
strain of Lactobacillaceae that could
7α-dehydroxylate bile acids in vitro
did not have the same catabolic
activity when transferred to germ-free
rats until additional bacterial strains
were introduced. Another study in
germ-free rats also showed the metabolic capacity of the gut microbiota,
specifically the reduction of bilirubin
to urobilins, which had been assumed
by some to be produced by the liver.
These initial studies laid the ground
for detailed work that explored the
links between microbial and host
metabolism (MILESTONE 12).
In addition to exploring the metabolic capacity of the gut microbiota,
GF animals were also essential for
elucidating the close links between
bacteria and the host that determine
tissue homeostasis and immune
system development. One striking
example is determination of the role
of segmented filamentous bacteria
(SFB), which had previously been
shown to closely interact with the
intestinal epithelium. Experiments
that led to monoassociation of germfree mice with SFB showed that
these bacteria are key determinants
of intestinal lymphocyte numbers
and phenotype in mice. Subsequent
studies have identified many links
between specific microbial taxa
and/or molecules and host immune
function (MILESTONE 9).
Germ-free animals have been,
and still are, indispensable tools for
studying functional relationships
between the microbiota and the
host — although, as always with
animal studies, the comparability and
applicability of the results to humans
need to be verified. Nevertheless, the
early studies using these models have
inspired several avenues of microbiota research and highlighted the
important effects the gut microbiota
have on their host.

Early life experiences have complex
and long-lasting effects that can
reach into adulthood — the same
can be said of the acquisition and
succession of our microbiota during
the first years of life. The culmination
of years of investigation from many
laboratories has led to an in-depth
characterization of postnatal
microbial acquisition and maturation
during the first years of life, and
has led to the realisation that this
represents a crucial window in our
long-term development.
Early studies, dating as far back
as 1900, described various aspects
of bacterial succession in infants,
but in 1981, three studies were
reported that set out to quantitatively
characterize early acquisition of
gut commensals and to study how
feeding shapes our initial microbiota.
In one study, development of the
bacterial community was investigated
in infants in Sheffield, England, by
culturing specimens taken from the
meconium (a baby’s first faeces),
faeces, mouth and umbilicus in the
first six days of life. In another study,
the faecal bacterial community was
compared between infant cohorts
Peppercorn and Goldman demonstrated that
the anti-inflammatory drug, salicylazosulfapyridine, could be degraded in conventional rats and
when cultured with human gut bacteria, but not
in germ-free rats, indicating a role for the gut
microbiota in drug transformations. An increasing
number of studies have confirmed the role of
the microbiota, not limited to the gut, in drug
metabolism and highlighted the implications for
drug inactivation, efficacy and toxicity.
in France that were either bottle-fed
or breastfed; and in the third study,
faecal bacterial communities from
breastfed infants, weaned children
and adults born in urban England
and rural Nigeria, were compared.
These studies provided quantitative
measurements of specific bacterial
taxa in early life, giving insight into
the pioneer species that colonize the
infant gut. This paved the way for
future high-resolution studies of
microbial succession in infants.
With the advent of ‘omics’
technologies in the following
decades, our understanding of when
the majority of our microbiota
are acquired, and of what species
are there, has heightened and the
importance of host–microbiota–
environment interactions during early
life has become realised. The infant
gut microbiota undergoes a period
of massive change in the first years of
life. The initial microbiota adapts over
time and is shaped by the availability
of different nutrients. As the infant
consumes increasingly more complex
dietary substrates, there are shifts
in composition and an enrichment
of bacterial functions related to
carbohydrate metabolism and the
biosynthesis of amino acids and
vitamins. By 2–3 years of age, a stable
microbiota develops that resembles
that of the adults in the infant’s
community (see MILESTONE 7).
When colonization first occurs
is an open question; however, most
scientists think that the foetus
develops in a sterile environment and
that we acquire the bulk of our initial
microbiota during and immediately
after birth. Recently, a few studies
have found traces of bacterial DNA
in the placenta, in the amniotic fluid
that surrounds the foetus and in the
meconium — suggesting prenatal
colonization. However, many
scientists think these findings could
be the result of contamination and
the debate is ongoing. Regardless of
possible exposure to microorganisms
in utero, the foetus is exposed to
microbial molecules that cross the
placenta from the mother.
The first major exposure to
microorganisms happens during
delivery, and is highly dependent on
the mode of delivery. The microbiota
of neonates that are born vaginally
are enriched in bacteria that resemble

the maternal vaginal microbiota
(for example, Lactobacillus species),
whereas neonates delivered by caesarean (C-) section lack these species
and are instead enriched in skin
commensals such as Staphylococcus,
Streptococcus and Propionibacterium
species. Over time, these differences
gradually reduce between vaginally
and C-section-born infants; however,
in one study, bacteria associated with
C-section remained associated
with C-section-delivered infants up
to two years of age, showing that
birth mode could have long-term
impacts on the microbiota.
Postnatal factors further
configure the microbiota in early
life. Breastmilk contains a complex
community of bacteria that may help
seed the infant gut microbiota, and in
breastfed infants the gut microbiota is
dominated by species that metabolise
human milk oligosaccharides.
Overall, diet has been found to
be a major determinant of the
infant gut microbiota. Studies of
malnourished infants have shown
that maturation of the gut microbiota
does not occur in a similar manner
to healthy infants, even after dietary
intervention, and it has been
proposed that an ‘undernourished’
microbiome in infancy can
perpetuate growth impairments
later in life.
The environment and people that
surround an infant are also a source
of microorganisms that can colonize
various body sites. Genetically
unrelated parents and even pets
share a high proportion of their
microbiota with infants. Genetics
also has a role in determining our
microbiota make-up, as evidenced by
associations between the heritability
of specific taxa and host genes.
The use of antimicrobials,
which is essential for preserving
life when infants acquire a serious
bacterial infection, can impact the
ecological succession of the infant
microbiota. Antibiotics can impair
the diversity and stability of the
developing microbiota in infants, with
abundances of specific taxa remaining
reduced for years after treatment. The
impact of antibiotics on the infant
microbiota could have long-lasting
health implications and their use
in early life has been linked to an
increased risk of several diseases,
including asthma, inflammatory
bowel disease and allergies (see
MILESTONE 9). More research is
required to uncover the underlying
mechanisms; however, what is clear
is that the microbiota has a vital role
in immune, endocrine, metabolic
and a variety of other developmental
pathways in infants, and without it we
would not be here today.

Over the past twenty years, advances in
DNA sequencing technology have deepened
our knowledge in every niche of biology,
from annotation of the human genome to
sequencing the human-associated microbial
metagenome, the genetic material of the
microorganisms that inhabit almost every
surface of the human body.
Study of the human microbiota historically relied on culture-dependent methods to
isolate and grow bacterial colonies in a predetermined medium. The inability to cultivate
a large portion of microorganisms, however,
substantially underestimated the biodiversity
of human-associated microbial communities.
An early milestone in this field was
the adoption of a technology, previously
pioneered by Carl Woese, Norman Pace and
others to identify environmental bacteria,
that was based on sequencing small subunit
ribosomal RNA genes (16S rRNA). Using this
approach, Wilson and Blitchington compared
the diversity of cultivated and noncultivated
bacteria within a human faecal sample in
1996. Since then, sequencing of 16S rRNA
genes from complex communities has become
a powerful tool for assessing microbial
diversity in the human microbiota. In 2005,
Eckburg et al. analysed samples not only from
faeces, but also from multiple colonic mucosal
sites. They sequenced >13,000 16S rRNA
genes, which constituted a substantial increase
in scope over previous work, and discovered
significant inter-subject variability and
greater differences between stool and mucosal
community composition than previously
described.
Sequencing of marker genes (such as 16S
rRNA) is traditionally associated with Sanger
sequencing, which requires a labour-intensive
cloning step and is prohibitively expensive for
large-scale microbiome studies. The advent
of next generation sequencing (NGS) offered
a cost-effective method that eliminated
the cloning step by amplifying 16S rRNA
genes using primers containing sequencing
adapters and barcodes. The massive parallel
sequencing throughput offered by NGS has
significantly increased the sequence depth of
16S rRNA genes, allowing for taxonomic and
phylogenetic analyses of complex microbial
communities. Yet, 16S rRNA sequencing cannot always resolve closely related species and
may miss the intra-species diversity. To better
capture the full picture, shotgun sequencing
was developed for direct sequencing of DNA.
The advantage is its capability to recover the
underrepresented microorganisms that were
often masked by high-abundance species.
Shotgun sequencing can use short-read
(such as Illumina) or long-read (for example,
Oxford Nanopore MinION and Pacific
Bioscience Sequel) platforms. The short-read
approach typically demands extensive computational support for assembling short reads
into meaningful sequences. However, an
accurate and complete assembly of genome
sequences is still hampered by the difficulty
in resolving long repetitive regions. Thus, reference-based sequencing methods emerged.
Concerted sequencing efforts have been
made to construct microbial reference
sequences. In 2007, the National Institutes
of Health launched the Human Microbiome
Project and, five years later, published the
first reference data for microorganisms
collected from 242 healthy United States
volunteers, covering a number of anatomical
sites such as mouth, nose, skin, lower intestine and vagina (MILESTONE 17). The valuable
genome references that were generated by
this consortium allow reliable identification
of individual microbial species, but fall
short when new genomes are present in the
community.
Long-read sequencing offers an alternative
solution for mapping challenging repetitive
regions. For example, single molecule, realtime (SMRT) DNA sequencing, in combination with a short-read shotgun DNA library,
allows for de novo microbial genome assemblies, although it suffers from high error rates.
Access to genome sequencing has
transformed human microbiome research
from focusing on identity characterizations,
to metagenomics approaches that not only
reveal microbial species but also how microbial metabolic activities correlate with human
health and disease.
In addition to metagenomics, metatranscriptomic analysis enabled by RNA
sequencing offers a way to detect active
members present in a microbial community
(MILESTONE 14).
The construction of metagenome-assembled genomes, an approach also pioneered
in environmental microbiology and recently
applied to human-associated communities, will provide a new, unprecedented
opportunity for deep characterization of the
functional potential of the human microbial
ecosystem.

A plethora of studies conducted over the past
few decades have revealed strong associations
between a disrupted microbiota and diseases, for
example, inflammatory bowel disease. However,
the key to understanding the role of a disrupted
microbiota in human diseases is first to answer
the question: what is a ‘normal’ microbiota?
This question still frustrates many
microbiologists, even with the advent of
high-throughput sequencing and ’omics
techniques. Prior to the availability of
these technologies, however, several
studies were instrumental in answering similar
questions to help define ‘normal’, such as how
much microbial variation is there between and
within adults, and is the microbiota stable?
In 1998, when conventional microbiological
techniques involving plate count analyses
had reached an impasse in what they could
reveal about human microbial diversity,
molecular approaches were instead beginning
to be implemented. A study by Willem de Vos
and colleagues used polymerase chain reaction
amplification of regions of the 16S ribosomal
(r)RNA gene, which is often used to infer the
genetic relationships between organisms, and
then temperature gradient gel electrophoresis
(TGGE) to visualize the diversity of the amplified
gene. Comparisons of the banding profiles
generated by TGGE from 16 adult faecal samples
indicated that each individual has their own
unique microbial community. Furthermore,
by monitoring two individuals over time, the
researchers showed that the TGGE profiles were
stable over a period of at least six months.
Similar molecular approaches were applied to
different sites of the human body, with the goal
of improving our understanding of adult human
microbial diversity. In 2005, one study moved
beyond using faecal microbiota as a surrogate
for the entire gut microbiota and sampled
multiple colonic mucosal sites from three healthy
individuals. Through an analysis of 13,335 16S
rRNA gene sequences, this work confirmed
marked microbial variation between individuals
and showed that the adult gut mucosal
microbiota was dominated by Bacteroidetes
and Firmicutes, whereas Actinobacteria,
Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia were
relatively minor constituents.
Another study went one step further, in
2009, and examined bacterial diversity of 27
body sites from at least seven individuals and at
four different time points. High interpersonal
variability was found across all body sites but
individuals experienced minimal temporal
diversity. Other studies dedicated to skin and
vaginal microbiomes were also key to our
understanding of an individualised microbiota. It
was found that comparable skin sites had similar
bacterial communities, but that the complexity
and temporal stability of the communities were
site-dependent, whereas other studies found
that the vaginal microbiome differs among
individuals and, markedly, change over a short
time. Together, these studies revealed that the
human microbiota is highly variable both within
and between individuals.
One of the goals of many studies characterising
the diversity and stability of the human
microbiota was to establish whether there was
a core microbiota — are there bacterial species
that we all share? In 2010, the international
MetaHIT (Metagenomes of the Human Intestinal
Tract) project published a gene catalogue derived
from 576.6 gigabases of metagenomic sequences
from the faecal samples of 124 individuals.
These genes were found to be largely shared by
individuals of the cohort, and 18 species were
detected in all individuals. However, a key study
that examined the faecal microbiomes of six
adult twin pairs and their mothers suggested
that there was an identifiable core microbiome at
the gene level rather than the microbial species
level. In this study, individuals shared >93% of the
enzyme-level functional groups, but no bacterial
phylotypes were present at >0.5% in all samples.
Many of these concepts were subsequently
confirmed in large-population studies published
by the Human Microbiome Project (HMP)
Consortium. Analysis of samples collected
from 242 healthy adults from up to 18
body sites showed that each habitat is
characterized by a small number of highly
abundant signature taxa, but that the relative
abundance of taxa and genes in each habitat
varies between individuals.
One drawback to the HMP dataset is the
limited temporal scope. Instead, other studies
have shed further light on the stability of the
adult microbiota. For example, in one study,
a human microbiota time series was obtained
covering two individuals at four body sites over
396 time-points (daily for up to 15 months).
Despite finding stable differences between
body sites and individuals, this high-resolution
temporal analysis did show pronounced
variability in an individual’s microbiota across
months, weeks and days. In another study, an
analysis of the faecal microbiota of 37 individuals
found that ~60% of bacterial strains remained
stable for up to five years.
Overall, samples obtained from the same
individual are more similar to one another than
those from different individuals, suggesting
each person has a microbiota that is distinct
and stable. Much is still unknown regarding how
stable the microbiota is to perturbations, such
as those arising from antibiotics, diet and the
immune system. However, further studies in-line
with those discussed here will no doubt enhance
our view of human microbiota dynamics to
ultimately understand what is ‘normal’.

While bacteria are a major component of the
human microbiota, viruses, fungi and archaea
are also important members of the community,
with potential effects on human health. The
development of 16S ribosomal RNA gene
sequencing transformed the field of microbiome
research by enabling bacterial and archaea
phylogenetic analyses without the need for
culturing (MILESTONE 6). Fungi can also be
identified and classified by sequencing a common
nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer
region. Viruses, however, are far more challenging
to isolate and sequence due to the necessity
of a eukaryotic or prokaryotic host and the
absence of conserved genes. The modern era of
human-associated viral metagenomics actually
started in the ocean. In 2001, the research group
of Forest Rowher, a marine microbial ecologist
at San Diego State University, published
a randomized shotgun library sequencing
method to analyse genomic DNA from a single
bacteriophage. This was rapid, reasonably
unbiased and required very little DNA input,
a crucial limiting variable for sequencing. The
research team further demonstrated the utility of
this technique beyond single phage analysis by
characterizing the more complex viral make-up
of seawater and marine sediment, paving the
way for analyses of human viromes and a deeper
characterisation of the human microbiome.
By 2003, bacteriophages that infected individual
bacterial species had been identified from
human faecal waste, but the diversity and relative
abundance of different phages remained unknown,
as existing approaches were biased towards
bacteria already known to be infected by phages.
By using the linker-amplified shotgun library
approach, Rowher’s research group provided the
first quantitative description of the composition of
the uncultured virome in human faeces collected
from a single healthy adult. The majority of phage
sequence matches were from temperate phages,
which commonly integrate into the host bacterial
genome. The faecal virome was also dominated by
phages known to infect Gram-positive bacteria, in
keeping with prior data on faecal bacterial content.
Viral metagenomics has continued to advance,
with higher-throughput techniques enabling
more rapid virus discovery and classification in
both healthy and diseased tissues, and helping
us to understand the role of commensal and
pathogenic viruses in the context of the wider
microbiome.
In a study published in 2010, by Jeffrey Gordon
and Rowher, faecal viromes of healthy adult
female twins and their mothers were shown to be
individually distinct and stable over the course
of a year, in agreement with faecal bacterial data
from this same cohort. Other studies have begun
to elucidate the effects of disease and diet on
the gut virome, finding that phage composition
became increasingly similar between individuals
on the same diet, and that significant expansion
of one phage order is associated with Crohn’s
disease and ulcerative colitis. Viral microbiome
signatures may therefore be associated with
environmental influences as well as disease
progression, including in tissues beyond the gut.
Shotgun metagenomics has facilitated a more
functional and interconnected perspective
of the microbiome, with the contributions of
fungi and archaea also becoming increasingly
understood. The human mycobiome (the
fungal community of humans) has also been
fruitfully studied. A number of recent studies
have highlighted the crucial roles of fungi in
both healthy and disease states. For example,
enteric commensal bacteria and fungi may have
redundant protective and tolerizing functions in
the context of regulating the immune response,
suggesting that gut homeostasis can be retained
through the mycobiome even in the absence of
‘good’ bacteria. In inflammatory bowel diseases,
however, mycobiome dysbiosis contributes to
disease progression, with fungi enriched at the
expense of bacteria. These data, along with other
studies, suggest a complex interplay between
fungi and bacteria.
Recently, the human archaeome (the
community of human-associated archaea)
has attracted interest due to a number of
observations, including recognition of the human
gut archaeon Methanosphaera stadtmanae by the
immune system and the discovery of previously
undetected human-associated archaea.
Methanogenic archaea are amongst the most
abundant microorganisms in the human gut and
sometimes outnumber even the most abundant
bacterial species. In 2004, methanogenic archaea
were found to be associated with the onset
of periodontal disease, identifying the first
link between archaea and human disease. As
with bacteria, viruses and fungi, archaea have
been isolated from various human anatomical
sites, including the gut, skin, vagina and oral
cavity. Yet, owing to fundamental differences in
biology, they have often remained undetected
in microbiome surveys, warranting further
investigation of the human archaeome and the
role of archaea in human health and disease.
As identification and characterization of the
human virome, mycobiome and archaeome in
various tissues and disease states continues
to improve, it will be increasingly important
to delineate function and how these other
‘omes’ interact as a community to preserve or
dysregulate human health.

The relationship between the immune system
and microorganisms was long viewed as a
war rather than a union, as it was mostly
studied in the context of host defence against
pathogens. Thus, when deficiency in lymphoid organ development and immune cell
activity was reported in germ-free animals in
the 1960s, this first evidence that microbiota
shape immune homeostasis was interpreted
as education of the immune system by
infections.
This concept laid the foundation for
the ‘hygiene hypothesis’, formalized by
David Strachan in 1989 in his influential
study reporting lower incidence of hay
fever and eczema in children with older
siblings. He proposed that infections in early
childhood prevent atopy later in life, and that
increased allergy prevalence in developed
countries may be caused by high standards of
personal hygiene. Further developments of
the hygiene hypothesis correlated pathogen
exposure to decreased allergy risk in humans,
and established a role for microbiota in oral
tolerance in mice, presumably in shifting an
immune set point from T helper 2 (Th2) to
Th1 cell responses.
In parallel, fundamental principles of
microorganism recognition by the immune
system unfolded. In 1989, Charles Janeway
proposed that immune responses are initiated
by genome-encoded pattern recognition
receptors (PRR) on immune cells, which sense
conserved microbial molecules. Over the next
decade, PRRs specific to various bacterial,
fungal and viral components were discovered.
However, it became evident that PRRs are not
specific to pathogens, posing the question of
how commensals, which colonize mucosal
surfaces, coexist with the immune system.
The prevailing explanation was that commensals and immune cells are separated by
epithelial barriers. This view was challenged in
the early 2000s by accumulating examples of
immune responses to commensals in healthy
mice. Among these, Andrew Macpherson,
Rolf Zinkernagel and colleagues found that
in mice, commensals are recognized and
compartmentalized by gut lumen-secreted
IgA. Lora Hooper, Jeffrey Gordon and coworkers reported that a commensal bacterium
stimulates antimicrobial peptide production
by Paneth cells.
In 2004, Seth Rakoff-Nahoum and Ruslan
Medzhitov provided evidence that the immune
system senses commensals through PRRs
under normal conditions and that this sensing
is crucial for tissue repair. This finding opened
a new perspective on immune response to
microorganisms not as host defence, but as a
symbiotic physiological process.
Realization of beneficial roles of immune–
microbial interactions prompted a revision
of the hygiene hypothesis to postulate that
protection from allergic diseases is mediated
by early-life exposure to commensals rather
than pathogens (MILESTONE 5). The refined
hypothesis suggested that the rise of allergies
in industrialized societies is caused by loss
of commensals. A link between lifestyle,
microbiota and allergic diseases has been
now confirmed in a large number of human
observational studies, and expanded to
implicate microbiota in other chronic inflammatory and autoimmune pathologies, as well
as metabolic and neurological disease.
Dissecting the underlying cellular and
molecular complexity of microbiota–immune
interactions has occupied microbiologists and
immunologists to this day. Pioneering works
by Sarkis Mazmanian, Dennis Kasper and
colleagues showed that microbiota-guided
maturation of the mouse immune system can
be recapitulated by a polysaccharide produced
by a symbiotic bacterium, and delineated
that its uptake by dendritic cells promotes
antigen presentation, inducing expansion
and differentiation of CD4+
 T cells into Th1
and regulatory T cell lineages. Ivaylo Ivanov,
Kenya Honda, Dan Littman and colleagues
uncovered how specific commensal bacteria direct Th17 cell differentiation in the
small intestine. In 2013–2014, four groups
independently discovered a mechanism of
immune tolerance mediated by metabolites
of intestinal commensals (MILESTONE 21).
Our intimate companion in sickness and
in health, microbiota impacts our physiology to a large extent through interactions
with the immune system at mucosal sites.
How these interactions, ranging from host
defence to active tolerance to symbiosis,
integrate into physiological outcomes
remains an exciting avenue to explore.

Most complex plant polysaccharides
are not digested by humans and enter
the colon as a potential food source
for the microbiota. But, in the late
1970s, the extent to which gut bacteria could metabolize this dietary fibre
was largely unknown.
To bridge this gap, Abigail Salyers
and colleagues tested the ability of a
wide range of anaerobic bacterial species resident in the human colon to
ferment plant polysaccharides as well
as intestinal mucins (glycosylated
proteins that line the gut epithelium).
They found that the bacterial strains
had a diverse and inducible ability to
break down different substrates, with
the largest variety of polysaccharides
fermented by Bifidobacterium and
Bacteroides species. The researchers
proposed that by altering availability
of preferred bacterial food sources in
the host diet — such as limiting fibre
intake — could trigger induction
of enzymes capable of degrading
the intestinal mucin layer, affecting
human health and even colon cancer.
But it was not until 2005 that
Jeffrey Gordon’s group demonstrated
that a change in diet in a mammal
could alter the degradative activity
of the colonic microbiota in vivo. By
colonizing the gut of germ-free mice
with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron
— which Salyers and colleagues
had identified as a human symbiont
capable of fermenting a wide range of
glycan substrates — the researchers
tested, in a physiologically relevant
setting, the effects of different diets
on expression of bacterial genes.
In mice fed a fibre-rich diet,
B. thetaiotaomicron genes involved
in polysaccharide metabolism were
significantly upregulated compared
to their expression in bacteria grown
in a minimal medium. By contrast,
in mice fed a diet devoid of complex
polysaccharides, the most highly
upregulated bacterial genes were those
involved in host glycan degradation.
The work confirmed in a vertebrate
the differential expression of bacterial
enzymes dependent on food source,
exposing a flexible network of
genes for harvesting glycans
based on their availability in
the host.
Subsequent work on
B. thetaiotaomicron elucidated
many of the gene clusters and
pathways involved in polysaccharide
metabolism that enable bacteria to
use the diversity of glycans provided
by a mammalian diet and the host
itself. This ability to harvest host glycans, such as during fluctuations of
a host’s diet, was shown to critically
affect survival of B. thetaiotamicron
in mono-colonized mice fed a fibrefree diet. Such findings, as well as
later studies, underscore the important interplay of host diet and glycan
metabolism for gut colonization of
human commensals and their persistence in populations over time.
We now know that gut microorganisms harbour thousands of
genes involved in catabolism of
carbohydrates, but how this enzymatic breadth was acquired remains
unclear. One potential source of
genetic diversity is horizontal transfer
of genes from environmental microorganisms to gut bacteria. In a search
for enzymes expressed by a marine
Bacteroidetes that degrade sulfated
polysaccharides found in edible
seaweed (such as nori), porphyranases
were identified that had a homologue
in a gut bacterium, Bacteroides plebeius. Additional porphyranases and
agarases were subsequently identified
in the microbiomes of Japanese but
not North American individuals. The
findings suggest that transfer of genes
from marine bacteria on nori was the
likely origin of enzymes in the human
gut that diversify the ability of bacteria
to harvest energy from food sources,
such as algal polysaccharides in
seaweed, a major dietary component
in Japan.
But do the nutrient foraging
properties of gut microbiota have
a role in human health? Results in
mice suggest they may. A fibre-free
diet in mice reduced the thickness of
the colonic mucus layer, as predicted,
and increased susceptibility to disease caused by a mouse enteric pathogen. In another study, the microbial
production of short chain fatty acids
from dietary fibre influenced mouse
lung disease and immune responses.
And microbial metabolism of other
components of the human diet, such
as L-carnitine in meat, has been
linked to atherosclerosis.
Much remains to be understood
of the impact of diet and the microbiota on human health and disease.
But these studies shed light on the
dynamic effect of altering host diet
on the makeup and behaviour of
microorganisms in the gut and other
organs, with potential implications for
disease modification and treatment.

Chronic inflammatory conditions,
such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, autoimmune disorders and cancer, have long been associated with
a Westernized diet. Environmental
factors also play a role, with the gut
microbiota taking centre stage in the
past two decades. Indeed, high-fat
diets (HFDs) regulate microbial
communities in drastic fashion. The
microbiota is now acknowledged as
having direct, even causative roles in
mediating connections between
the environment, food intake and
chronic disease.
Early studies using germfree mice showed that body fat
content and insulin resistance
are transferable from obese to lean
mice through exposure to faecal
material. In a pioneering paper,
researchers found that the microbiota
of obese mice are more efficient
at extracting energy from the host
diet compared to the microbiota
of lean ones and that increased
adiposity is transferable. When
the microbiota from the cecum of
obese mice, which had a higher
Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio than
lean donors, were transplanted into
germ-free recipients, there was a
greater increase in body fat than in
recipients of microbiota from lean
mice. Notably, the structure of the
established colonizing community
in the recipient was highly similar to
that of the original donor, suggesting
that the composition of the donor
microbiota is critical for development
of the obese phenotype.
Subsequent studies using
gnobiotic mice (with a defined microbiota) showed that a single endotoxin-producing Enterobacter species
isolated from an obese human’s gut
was sufficient to induce obesity,
insulin-resistant phenotypes and
systemic inflammation in mice fed a
HFD. The results, derived from the
first gnobiotic mouse obesity model,
also represent the first demonstration
of a causative role of the microbiota in
human obesity.
These findings have raised the
possibility of developing therapies
based on modulating the microbiota.
One such proof-of-principle study
found that small intestinal infusion
of the gut microbiota from a lean
donor restored insulin sensitivity
and increased the microbial diversity
(with concomitant short-chain fatty
acid metabolism) in obese human
subjects with untreated metabolic
syndrome. This study also described
a role for butyrate from gut microbial metabolism in improving insulin
sensitivity, a first step in defining
specific species and mechanisms
used by gut microorganisms to
modulate host physiology. Extending
these findings beyond adiposity and
insulin resistance, host phenotypes
were also found to be transferable
in mice by co-housing or through
vertical transmission. For instance,
a colitis phenotype (resembling
human ulcerative colitis) can be
induced by genetic mutation or can
be transferred, vertically to wildtype
progeny or horizontally to wildtype
cage-mates, through co-housing
— a process that is blocked with
antibiotics.
More recently, the intestinal microbiota has been shown to modulate
neurological and psychiatric diseases,
as well as cancer, adding to those
phenotypes that can be transferred
by faecal material or mother-to-child
transmission. Intestinal tumours can
be induced in mice harbouring an
oncogenic mutation in Kras with a
HFD, independent of obesity, and this
effect can be transferred to healthy
adult, normal-diet, Kras mutant mice
via the dysbiotic gut microbial community found in the faecal material
of HFD mice. Inflammation-induced
colorectal cancer is transferrable
to co-housed mice, an effect that is
blocked by antibiotic treatment of
donor mice. The impact of gut microorganisms on promoting obesity and
liver cancer induced by a Westernized
diet is trans-generational — it can
be seen in the progeny as well as
the grandchildren of mother mice
consuming the diet, even though the
mothers themselves are unaffected
by these conditions. Finally, the
intestinal microbiota influences brain
development and function in mice.
For instance, distinct anxiety levels of
different mouse strains are linked to
distinct microbiota compositions and
the phenotypes are transferrable via
faecal matter.
There is a large body of anecdotal
and direct evidence suggesting that
the microbiota has a role in the
health of many human functional
systems. Being able to transmit
phenotypes via whole microbiota,
individual microorganisms or, eventually, through individual microorganism-derived metabolites, should
prove revolutionary for treatment of
disease and maintenance of a healthy
human condition.

While studies had made it clear that
our gut microbiota could metabolize
dietary components (MILESTONE 10),
it was yet to be confirmed whether
these diet–microbiota interactions had
implications for human health.
Jeffrey Gordon’s group jump started
research into the links between the gut
microbiota and obesity with a series of
mouse studies. In 2004, this group found
that germ-free mice had reduced body
fat compared to conventional mice,
even though they consumed less food.
A year later it was shown that a mouse
model of obesity had an altered ratio of
the two main phyla present in the gut;
the Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes. A
functional analysis of these microbiomes
revealed that an obesity-associated
microbiota had an increased capacity
for energy harvest, and this phenotype
could be transferred through faecal
microbiota transplant (MILESTONE 11).
Members of the Gordon lab continued
this line of research, but this time in
humans. In 2006, Ley et al. found that
obese individuals had a reduction in the
relative abundance of Bacteroidetes
compared to lean individuals, and
that this could be reversed using
diet. This triggered numerous studies
of the microbiota in the context of
obesity and malnutrition. While many
were in agreement and identified an
obesity-associated microbiota, others
identified no trend, the opposite trend
or found that diet was in fact the main
driver, rather than the obese state.
Given the conflicting results, three
reanalysis papers were published, using
publicly available datasets, in an attempt
to uncover conserved microbiota
signatures of obesity. The overarching
results were that phylum-level signatures
were not generalizable, especially at
the population level, however Shannon
diversity and evenness, the number of
operational taxonomic units, and obesity
status did have significant associations,
albeit relatively weak.
However, diet was found to
consistently alter the gut microbiota. For
example, the high-fibre diets that are
typically consumed by rural communities
were associated with increased microbial
diversity, an enrichment of Prevotella
species, higher concentrations of
health-promoting short-chain fatty acids
and a reduction in metabolic disease.
Studies on a range of other metabolic
diseases in relation to the microbiota
and diet, such as type 2 diabetes and
cardiovascular disease, also emerged.
A clear link between the ability of the
gut microbiota to metabolise dietary
phosphatidylcholine into trimethylamine-N-oxide and the development of
cardiovascular disease was confirmed in
a series of papers by Stanley Hazen and
colleagues.
Given the substantial impact of diet
on the microbiota, numerous research
groups have attempted to harness
this power in order to modulate the
gut microbiota to alleviate metabolic
disease. In 2015, Zeevi et al. used gut
microbiota data, together with blood
parameters and metadata, to develop
a machine-learning algorithm that
could predict an individual’s glycemic
response to a particular meal, resulting
in a personalized diet that could lower
post-meal glucose. A more general
dietary intervention was recently used for
the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
In 2018, Zhao et al. used a high-fibre diet
to promote colonization by short-chain
fatty acid producers and to improve
haemoglobin A1c levels, which was used
as a readout of type 2 diabetes status.
These studies highlight the crucial
impact that diet can have on the gut
microbiota and host metabolism, the
resulting implications for human health,
and how we can use our knowledge
of these interactions to develop
nutrition-based treatments.

In 1917, as war was tearing its
way across Europe, a fascinating
scientific observation was being
made. The German physician
Alfred Nissle had been looking for
novel therapies to tackle enteric
infections, which in this pre-antibiotic era represented an enormous
burden on troops. He noted that
one soldier in particular, who had
participated in a military campaign
in the Balkans, proved stubbornly
resistant to dysentery when many
of his comrades had been laid low
by the disease. Speculating that a
component of this soldier’s intestinal
microbiota might be responsible
for this resistance, Nissle acquired
stool samples and was able to isolate
a strain of bacteria that came to be
known as Escherichia coli Nissle
1917. Laboratory testing, as well as
some self-experimentation on the
part of Nissle, showed that this novel
strain of E. coli was indeed able to
antagonise pathogenic bacteria and
it soon entered clinical practice.
Although his identity is lost to
history, the soldier’s donation of his
unique E. coli strain is still used to
this day as the active component of
the probiotic Mutaflor.
In many ways, the findings of
Nissle were built on earlier concepts
articulated by the ‘father’ of cellular
immunology Élie Metchnikoff,
who in a monograph in 1910 had
lauded the consumption of soured
milk (rich in bacteria) as a means
to stave-off infectious disease and
enhance human longevity. Indeed,
peasants from the Balkans and
Caucasus had long-been famous
not only for their centenarians but
also for millennia-old traditions of
yoghurt-making. However, while
it seemed that certain strains of
bacteria could have beneficial properties on their host, perhaps in part
through their direct antagonism of
enteric pathogens, the mechanistic
basis of these remarkable effects
were almost wholly unknown.
Arguably, the first in-roads into
this question were made in the
mid-1920s, in Belgium, by an
often-overlooked early pioneer
of microbiology — André Gratia.
Along with his colleagues, most
notably Sarah Dath, Gratia observed
antagonism between co-cultures of
different strains of E. coli. This effect
was attributed to a secreted factor,
which came to be known as ‘colicin’.
This protein now represents the first
described member of an unrelated
family of narrow-spectrum, bacterially-produced antibiotics known as
‘bacteriocins’.
Another important step in
understanding the role played by
the host’s microbiota in resistance to
enteropathogenic bacteria was made
in the 1950s, by Marjorie Bohnhoff
and colleagues at the University
of Chicago, and subsequently in
the early 1970s by Dirk van Waaij
and colleagues in the Netherlands.
Secondary infections are a common
occurrence following a course of
antibiotics, suggesting that some
perturbation of the microbiota
might be responsible. In order to
model this phenomenon, these
studies found that mice that had
their microbiota heavily-depleted
by antibiotics were drastically more
susceptible to oral challenge with
even mildly pathogenic strains of
Salmonella or E. coli. A 1971 paper
by van Waaij and colleagues was
especially important for its coining
of the term ‘colonization resistance’
and placing it into a quantitative
framework.
The host’s microbiota can
manifest colonization resistance
through a number of potential
mechanisms, for example, ‘passively’
by out-competing bacteria for
space and trophic resources, or
more actively by the generation of
bacteriocidal factors. Three key
papers in 2007 illuminated different
aspects of colonization resistance.
The probiotic strain Lactobacillus
salivarius UCC118 is known to produce the bacteriocin Apb118. Conor
Gahan and colleagues observed that
this probiotic strain could protect
mice against infection with Listeria
monocytogenes and this effect was
wholly dependent on the production
of Apb118. However, L. salivarius
UCC118 also conferred protection
against a strain of Salmonella
resistant to Apb118, suggesting
that colonization resistance by this
probiotic is more multi-faceted than

simply the production of a bacteriocin. A second pair of unrelated
papers set out to understand how
enteropathogens could overcome
colonization resistance. In separate
mouse studies and using different
enteropathogens (Citrobacter rodentium or Salmonella), it was shown
that intestinal inflammation altered
the composition of the host’s microbiota and made them susceptible to
colonization by the invading bacteria. In both cases the bacteria needed
to be able to elicit gut inflammation
in order to establish themselves — in
other words, this appeared to be a
case of the enteropathogen co-opting
the host’s immune response to its
advantage.
Colonization resistance has
proved to be a useful model for
understanding the dynamics of
microbial communities in the gut
and other barrier surfaces, such as
the skin, however in one sense it is
strikingly similar to the much earlier
ecological concept of ‘allelopathy’.
Initially outlined in the 1930s to
describe interactions between
certain plant species, allelopathy was
later broadened to describe the suppression of any competitor organism
by another through the generation
of biologically active factors.
As we teeter towards the dangers
a post-antibiotic era, further insights
from the study of colonization resistance could offer the hope of novel
antimicrobial therapies.

Antibiotics not only act on bacteria
that cause infections but also affect
the resident microbiota. Although
this side effect has long been appreciated, advances in sequencing technologies enabled detailed study of how
antibiotics alter the gut microbiome.
Although the composition of
the gut microbiota varies between
individuals, the community in each
individual is relatively stable over
time (MILESTONE 7). In 2008, Relman
and colleagues studied three healthy
individuals and showed that treatment
with ciprofloxacin influenced the
abundance of about one third of
bacterial taxa in faecal samples. These
changes decreased the taxonomic
richness, diversity and evenness of the
community. Although most bacterial
groups recovered after treatment,
several taxa did not (even after six
months) and the level of reconstitution varied between the individuals. A
follow-up study showed that a second
course of ciprofloxacin had similar
effects. There was no correlation
between the magnitude of the microbiome shift in the first and second
treatments within any individual; each
treatment was another ‘roll of the dice’.
Owing to the close links between
the resident microbiota and the
host, such disturbance of the
microbiota by antibiotics can be
expected to affect host physiology
and potentially host health. Indeed,
one study found that administration of antibiotics to young mice
increased adiposity and levels of
metabolic hormones in the blood,
and faecal transplantation from
antibiotic-treated mice to germ-free
mice transferred the metabolic
phenotype. Besides effects on
metabolism, the gut microbiota also
closely interacts with and influences
the host immune system, and thus
microbiome disturbances have the
potential to affect the development of
several autoimmune, inflammatory
and allergic diseases.
Antibiotic treatment of mice from
birth also alters the expression of
genes and the number of cells that
regulate immune responses. Pulsed
antibiotic treatment increased the
incidence of type-1 diabetes in susceptible mice, and the relative levels
of anti-inflammatory T cells were
lower in these mice (prior to the onset
of disease) than in untreated mice.
Neonatal treatment with antibiotics
increased the susceptibility of adult
mice to imiquimod-induced psoriasis.
Similar observations have been
made for asthma. Children who are
exposed to antibiotics in their first
year of life had a slightly increased
risk of developing asthma, and the
risk increased with the number of
antibiotic courses. Regression analysis
from children with asthma identified
that early exposure to antibiotics is
a risk factor. The abundance of the
genera Faecalibacterium, Lachnospira,
Veillonella and Rothia (FLVR) were
decreased in children at three months
of age who had been treated with antibiotics and later developed asthma.
In faecal transfer experiments from
one of these children, the addition of
FLVR decreased disease severity in an
asthma mouse model. The changes in
community composition were accompanied by changes in metabolites such
as acetate, a short chain fatty acid that
is known to influence host metabolism and immune function. In another
study, early life exposure to the antibiotic vancomycin indeed increased
immunoglobulin E and decreased
regulatory T cell levels in mice.
A study looking at antibiotic
perturbation of the gut microbiota
and the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease, also showed
that transfer of the disturbed gut
microbiota from mouse mothers to
their newborn pups, promoted and
accelerated the development of gut
inflammation in the offspring.
Certain interventions could help
restore the gut microbial community
to its original state if antibiotics are
needed. For example, Elinav and
colleagues recently found that the
administration of certain probiotics
hindered, and autologous faecal
transplantation helped restore, the
microbiome.
The observation that the gut
microbiome can be permanently
perturbed even by short-term or
low-dose antibiotic treatment, and
that this change can have long-term
effects on health, cautions against
widespread and potentially unnecessary use of antibiotics, particularly in
young children and pregnant women,
and illustrates that antibiotics should
not be considered harmless. However,
it also raises hopes for microbiome
modulation as a therapeutic treatment
for immune conditions.

Microbiome composition and function have been implicated in various
diseases. However, understanding
and exploiting the interactions of the
microbiome with the human host
is tempered by the huge diversity of
the microbiome within and between
individuals. Advances in metagenomics and high-throughput sequencing
in the early 2000s, inspired projects
aimed at capturing microbiome
diversity in large human populations.
For example, one of the first such projects, Metagenomics of the Human
Intestinal Tract, studied faecal samples from 124 individuals, generating
576.7 gigabases of sequence data.
The authors noted that this is “almost
200 times more than in all previous
studies” and “provides a broad view of
the functions important for bacterial
life in the gut”.
Besides the scientific achievement
of this and similar projects, such as
the Human Microbiome Project,
Belgian Flemish Gut Flora Project,
Dutch LifeLines-DEEP study and
others, one should note and acknowledge the fruitful collaboration of
these large scientific consortia, lately
even including citizen scientists in
American Gut. Furthermore, dedicated support from several funders
has been essential.
As mentioned above, initial studies looked at around 100 individuals;
by contrast, today’s studies can contain samples from several thousand
participants. Larger numbers, as well
as refinement and standardisation
of protocols and pipelines, and the
availability of larger reference data
sets — all of which have profited
hugely from early microbiome
population studies — add to the
robustness of results. Sometimes it
has been difficult to compare studies
and there have been studies with
contradictory results. Nevertheless,
large population studies have greatly
advanced our understanding of
what constitutes a ‘normal’ human
microbiome, although this statement
should be qualified by the fact that
North Americans and Europeans are
the best-studied populations. Projects
are underway to ameliorate this bias.
In general, the microbiome differs
not only between healthy individuals and those with diseases, even
between healthy people there is a
large diversity — there is no uniform
‘healthy’ microbiome. Some general
measures, such as high taxonomic
and functional richness, which
usually correlate with a diverse, fibrerich diet, seem to be beneficial.
Population studies have also
identified factors that shape the
microbiome, and have helped quantify their impact, including body site,
diet, drugs, host genetics and others.
Furthermore, it has been possible to
identify disease-specific microbiome
signals, for example, for type-1 diabetes mellitus (MILESTONE 9), metabolic
syndrome, obesity (MILESTONE 12),
inflammatory bowel disease and others. Notably, the second phase of the
Human Microbiome Project used an
integrative approach that combines
several ’omics techniques to study the
role of the microbiome in preterm
birth, the development of type-2
diabetes mellitus and inflammatory
bowel disease over time. Identifying
such signals is a first step towards
understanding how the microbiome
might contribute to disease development, and towards the development
of preventative and therapeutic
applications.
For example, individual microbiome differences are associated with
the response to cancer treatment
(MILESTONE 24). This finding and
other studies have inspired plans
to exploit microbiome differences
for individualized therapies and
interventions.
In summary, large population
studies have greatly advanced our
understanding of gut microbiome
diversity and have identified numerous
potential links to health and disease,
inspiring many new research avenues.
They have also made essential contributions to establishing methods
and standards on which future work
can build. Finally, these studies have
highlighted the importance of the
microbiome, not only for scientists
but also for the general public.

A link between the gut microbiota and the brain
has long been surmised, but in recent decades,
studies have started to report causal effects of
the gut microbiota on our brains and behaviour,
and the underlying molecular mechanisms have
begun to be elucidated.
Several early studies in animal models provided
evidence that stress can perturb the composition
of the gut microbiota and that enteric pathogens
can affect host behaviour. In 2004, a study showed
that germ-free (GF) mice exhibit an upregulated
hormonal response to stress induced by physical
restraint, implying that the microbiota influences
the neuroendocrine hypothalamic–pituitary–
adrenal (HPA) axis, the central stress response
system. However, the effects of the microbiota
— or the absence thereof — on behaviour
remained unclear. Seven years later, in 2011,
several experimental findings in mice shed light
on how a lack of conventional microbiota affects
behaviour, gene expression in the brain and the
development of the nervous system.
Studies revealed that GF and antibiotic-treated
mice displayed reduced anxiety-like behaviour
compared with specific pathogen-free (SPF)
controls. For example, GF mice were found
to spend more time on the open arms of the
elevated plus maze (EPM), and in the illuminated
compartment of the light–dark box, than their
SPF counterparts. The offspring of GF mice that
had been conventionalized with SPF microbiota,
but not GF mice conventionalized as adults,
showed behaviour similar to SPF controls,
suggesting that the microbiota may influence the
brain during a ‘critical period’ of development.
Related work showed an effect of differences
in gut microbiota on behaviour. Mice treated
with a mixture of antimicrobials (ATM) showed
more exploratory behaviour, and GF BALB/c
mice (which are typically timid) colonized with
microbiota from another mouse strain exhibited
more exploratory behaviour than those receiving
BALB/c microbiota, and vice versa. Furthermore,
it was found that treatment of SPF mice with the
probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus (JB-1) reduced
anxiety- and depression-like behaviour.
As well as behavioural differences, the brains
of animals with altered or absent gut microbiota
displayed various molecular differences. These
included brain-region-specific changes in
levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF; which is known to be modulated in
anxiety and depression), differences in the
expression of various neurotransmitter receptors
and alterations in the turnover of certain
neurotransmitters, including serotonin.
Indeed, much research since has focused on
serotonin as a node of gut microbiota–brain
interactions. Spore-forming gut bacteria were
found to drive the production of serotonin by
enterochromaffin cells in the mouse colon,
although exactly how this may affect the brain has
not been clear. Moreover, male (but not female) GF
mice show higher levels of hippocampal serotonin
and plasma levels of a serotonin precursor,
suggesting that certain influences of the gut
microbiota on the brain may be sex-specific.
How the gut microbiota signal to the brain has
been the focus of much research. Evidence from
models of multiple sclerosis and stroke suggested
that changes in the gut microbiota may indirectly
influence the central nervous system via effects
on immune homeostasis and immune responses.
In support of a vagus-nerve mediated route for
gut-derived signals, severing the vagus nerve
below the diaphragm blocked the anxiolytic and
gene expression effects of L. rhamnosus (JB-1). By
contrast, ablating the vagus nerve or sympathetic
nerves did not prevent the effects of ATM on
anxiety-like behaviour, and ATM-treated mice
showed no overt signs of gut inflammation or
alterations in enteric neurotransmitter levels,
indicating that some gut–brain communication
routes might be independent of the immune and
nervous systems.
In fact, later research has started to uncover
other means of gut–brain communication — in
particular, microorganism-derived products
that can directly or indirectly signal to the
nervous system. For example, the offspring of
immune-challenged mice showed gut dysbiosis,
disrupted intestinal integrity and behavioural
abnormalities (including anxiety-like behaviour),
as well as high serum levels of a microbial
metabolite that, when injected into wild-type
mice, induced anxiety-like behaviour. Similarly,
in a model of Parkinson disease (a neurological
disorder associated with α-synuclein
aggregation in the brain) the presence of gut
microbiota or microbially produced short-chain
fatty acids promoted neuroinflammation, motor
impairments and α-synuclein pathology.
Nearly all of the work in this field to date
has been carried out in animal models, and
establishing whether those findings translate
to humans will be crucial yet challenging. As
an example of such an endeavour, a study
investigated the link between faecal microbiota
composition and quality of life using data from
more than 1,000 people. As well as identifying
bacterial genera associated with higher
quality of life or depression, they carried out
metagenomic analyses that indicated that
the potential of microorganisms to synthesize
certain neuroactive metabolites may also
correlate with mental wellbeing.
Together, the studies described above have
laid the foundations for our understanding of the
effects of the gut microbiota on the brain and
behaviour, and the mechanisms that underlie
them, and represent initial efforts to explore the
relevance of animal-model findings for humans.

High-throughput anaerobic culturing enabled the
recovery of a large part of the diverse human gut
microbiota and the creation of individual culture
collections.
Genetic variation occurs between human
populations living in different places,
but little was known about variation
in microbiomes. To investigate how
gut microbiomes differ among human
populations, Yatsunenko et al. characterized
bacterial species in faecal samples from
cohorts living in different regions, including
the Amazonas of Venezuela, rural Malawi
and US metropolitan areas. The authors
found pronounced differences in the
composition and functions in the gut
microbiomes between these geographically
distinct cohorts.
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are crucial in maintenance
of immune homeostasis. In 2013, three studies
found that microbiota-derived short-chain fatty
acids promote the expansion and differentiation
of Tregs, revealing a form of chemical-mediated
communication between the commensal microbiota
and the immune system that affects immune
mechanisms.

Following earlier studies in mouse models, gut microbiota composition was shown to affect the
response of melanoma patients, and those suffering from advanced lung or kidney cancer, to
immune checkpoint therapy, as well as tumour control.
Identification of biosynthetic
gene clusters for antibiotics
in the genomes of the
human microbiota,
suggests new sources of
antimicrobial drugs whose
species-specific production
has the potential to modulate
the local microbial community
structure.
Advances in computational methods,
recently pioneered in the environmental
microbiology field, enable the reconstruction
of bacterial genomes from metagenomic
datasets. This approach was used to identify
thousands of new uncultured candidate
bacterial species from the gut and other body
sites, of global populations from rural and
urban settings, substantially expanding the
known phylogenetic diversity and improving
classification of understudied, non-Western
populations.
Commonly used medications affect gastrointestinal microbial
abundances and bacterial gene expression, which may both positively
and negatively
contribute to the
effects on human
health associated
with drug
treatment.
